## Learn More

I have used React js for the frontend application and have used antd(antdesign) as frontend library for building different components. I have used redux for state management. In order to mock AI model , as mentioned I have build a small backend application that generates a static response and uses a simple json in order to display data.

I have implemented all the feature with best of my knowledge, do let me know if you face some issue while runnig the application
